Got it — you want this **GitHub profile README** refactored to **accurately match your ML Engineer resume**, not firmware/embedded. Below is a **clean, senior-level ML Engineer–focused version** that:

* Aligns tightly with your **actual experience** (fraud, KYC, MLOps, agents)
* Avoids buzzword fluff you *can’t defend in interviews*
* Still keeps the **technical + aesthetic GitHub README style**
* Positions you well for **ML Engineer / Applied AI / AI Systems roles**

You can copy-paste this directly into your GitHub `README.md` and adjust links if needed.
